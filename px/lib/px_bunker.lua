-- Bunker Buster / Super Bunker Buster -- Worms Reloaded's air-strike drill,
-- rebuilt for WormForge API 4. PX's own version is
-- PX_pending/bunker_buster/scripts/bunkerbuster.txt; every number below cites
-- a line of it.
--
-- PX: an air strike (`CWorm::FireFinal`, :631-653) whose bomb is a mine-bodied
-- object, `PxBunkerBuster : CMine` (:106), dropped by a plane standing still
-- (`BombSpX/SpY = 0`, :637-638). The body falls on WA's gravity
-- (`GravityFactor = 1`, :255). Touching land switches it to drilling
-- (`Collide` -> `StartDigging`, :305-318): gravity off (:238), a direction and
-- a speed per frame (`SpX = DirX * DrillSpeed`, :497-498), terrain cut with
-- WA's own drill masks (`ApplyMask(1, ...)` at the body and `ApplyMask(13, ...)`
-- at two side offsets, :508-510), fuel spent per pixel drilled (:516), and
-- WA's own drill hole as it goes -- the pneumatic drill's mask, by PX's own
-- comment (:496). Out of land ahead it falls again (:530-537); out of fuel it
-- blows up (:523-527), as it does on touching anything that is not land
-- (:320-323, its `ColGroupDigging`, :185-196).
--
-- The port does not copy PX's implementation, only its behaviour and numbers.
-- The request is explicit: PX's body "bounces" where it should drill, and its
-- magnet steering (:449-452) goes:
--
--   * the fall: WA's gravity from above the level, at the click's x --
--     PX's plane drop, minus the plane;
--   * the drill: one fixed step down, at 1.5 px a frame (PX randomizes 0.5..2.0
--     every 5..15 frames, :463-467; its own top speed is `DrillMaxSpeed = 2.0`,
--     :127). A fixed step is how WA's own diggers move and is immune to a push,
--     as the request asks (PX's direction itself is steered by the magnet,
--     :449-452 -- dropped); 1.5 is a quarter under PX's top speed, from playtest;
--   * the hole: `wa.land.cut{ shape = "drill" }`, WA's own drill mask, which is
--     the shape PX's masks 1 and 13 make (super_drill.lua:17, cut_lab.lua:12).
--     PX cuts only while drilling (:508-510); the port cuts every 10 frames
--     whatever the body is doing, so a buster that has fallen into a wall gets
--     its hole cut for it instead of sitting there (seen stuck in match);
--   * the "limited distance": PX's `DrillFuelAmount = 880` (:124) spent per pixel
--     (:516). The port counts frames of drilling instead -- 587, which is PX's 880 px at
--     this port's 1.5 px a frame -- so the clock ticks only while the drill is going:
--     it pauses when the buster falls and carries on when it hits again, and is never
--     refreshed by a penetration (which is what let it dig without end);
--   * leaving the land: PX probes 10 px ahead of the body with its collision
--     mask (:530) and falls when there is no land there. The port runs a line
--     at each edge of the body instead (the request's "line check on both
--     edges"), and keeps drilling while either edge still has land;
--   * the detonation: fuel out (:523-527), or touching a worm, crate, oil drum
--     or mine (:320-323). WR's list is worm, crate and barrel; mines are PX's
--     own addition to it;
--   * the blast: the plain buster one, the super five, stepped 8 frames apart
--     along the line across the drill (`ExplosionDistance = 40`,
--     `ExplosionDeltaTime = 8`, :138-139, :393-416). Blast and damage are PX's
--     (:148-149, :159-160). The five blasts are WR's "horizontal flare that
--     cuts sideways through the terrain", made of blasts;
--   * the super's fire: PX's `CFireDesc` (:31-36) -- a one-flame fire every
--     4..10 frames while drilling (:472-494), and a six-flame fire at each
--     blast (:330-339).
--
-- What the API cannot carry (presentation only; REPORT.md 9.3):
--   * the drilling flames' full throw. PX throws each up the shaft at 5..15 a
--     frame within 45 degrees of the drill (:480-486); the port tosses it
--     gently (FIRE_TOSS), from just above the body, into the open shaft. Left
--     at the body with `wa.fire.spawn`'s default fall, flames lay against the
--     land being drilled, and one caught on the shaft's wall over nothing held
--     a turn forever (the engine now puts such a flame out);
--   * the smoke and dust particles (:555-606);
--   * a sound that can be **stopped**. `wa.sound.play` and `a:sound` can neither
--     loop nor stop, and PX's drill wav (20.95 s -- an impact, then a long drill, with
--     no loop point in it) played once left the drilling going long after the buster
--     was gone -- in match, through every later shot. The port cuts that wav into an
--     impact piece and five loop pieces of 105 whole frames
--     (`porting-analysis/tools/split_wav.py`), plays the impact on **every** entry
--     into the land and the loop pieces in order while drilling, and stops playing
--     when the digging stops. The Attack Helicopter's rotor is the same idea with one
--     piece (`weapons/attack_helicopter.lua:71,410`);
--   * the `space` early detonation (:655-676) -- no such key is exposed;
--   * the magnet steering (:449-452), dropped on purpose.
--
-- Girders: the trace has no girder kind, so a girder in the path is simply
-- passed through -- which is WR's "burrows through terrain and girders".
--
-- A component's file, and anything it requires, runs where `wa` does not exist
-- yet: this module is pure data at load and touches `wa` only in `install`.
--
-- The two weapons are independent: each has its own component, record, sprites,
-- sounds and numbers, and a component that is in **no** panel slot registers
-- nothing (`placed` below), so either can be placed on its own -- and one of the
-- two unplaced does not take the match down with it.

-- Whether the profile placed this component on a panel slot.
--
-- A component that is in **no** slot must not register a weapon: the engine
-- builds one for every registration, and a slot-less weapon takes the match
-- down at turn start ("converting Lua nil to table" -- the panel cell it looks
-- up is nil). With two weapons in one bundle that is the difference between
-- placing either alone and a hard crash, so this asks first.
--
-- The placed set is the loader's own: `ctx.placed`, the placed weapons in slot
-- order, each `{ id, position }` (`tools/audit/audit.lua:39-41`,
-- `highlander components/highlander.lua:16-17`), and `ctx.weapons`, the same
-- ids as keys (`highlander components/loader.lua:91`). Either listing this
-- component is enough; only when a field is there and neither lists it is the
-- component in no slot. A context with neither field registers as before, so
-- nothing is lost if the fields move.

  -- re-plays it every 15 s while digging (`:240`, `:609-624`); `a:sound` can neither loop nor
  -- stop a sound, so playing it once ran the drilling on long after the buster was gone, and
  -- through every later shot.
  --
  -- The pieces are cut for the game's own frame rate, which is **50 fps** -- not 60, which cost
  -- this weapon one round of "the sound cuts, every time": PX's helicopter rotor, the one loop
  -- that has always been inaudible, is 0.9155 s of audio re-triggered every 47 frames
  -- (`weapons/attack_helicopter.lua:71,410`), which is 0.94 s at 50 fps (24 ms short of the
  -- audio, inaudible) and 0.78 s at 60 fps (the audio cut by 132 ms a cycle). A piece cut for the
  -- wrong rate is cut short by that rate's error on every cycle, which is exactly what was heard.
  --
  -- The wav's own period is 1.75 s, and at 50 fps the nearest whole frame count is 88 (1.76 s,
  -- 10 ms over the period, so five pieces wrap within 50 ms of phase). So the first 10.56 s cuts
